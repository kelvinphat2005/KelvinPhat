                        Grief is "deep sorrow, especially that caused by someone's death." However, when emotions caused by grief start to become so "long lasting and severe" that it impacts your ability to work and live, grief can become complicated grief.
                    </p><p>
                        Complicated grief commonly forms the death of a loved one from suicide and sudden/unexpected deaths. 
                    </p><p>
                        However, the effects of stress due to deaths for any reason, can also lead to complicated grief.
                    </p><p>
                        Effects of complicated grief include: detoriation of normal function, loss of purpose in life, and suicidal thinking.

                        Apathy is the indifference and lack of motivation to do anything. The source of apathy may stem from a variety of subjects but is commonly formed from traumatic events. When people get tired enough that they no longer take care of themselves or anything around them it becomes apathy.
                    </p><p>
                        Apathy commonly stems from prolonged exposure to stress and trauma, without any support or motivation to deal with it. 
                    </p><p> Without support people often attempt to solve their stress by themselves, and without a proper way to deal with such stress, people often become indifferent to stop dealing with stress or trauma entirely.</p>
