                    People with positive attitudes and outlooks live longer and feel better in the process.  “Pessimists are their own worst enemies.  They expect the worst.  They predict the worst.  They prepare for the worst, and the worst often happens to them.  Life tends to live down to their expectations” (Ramsey, 2000).  Pessimistic people make death seem like an end to life, instead of the beginning of eternity.  Most optimists are realistic in accepting that problems, setbacks, and tragedies such as death happen.  They just refuse to allow reversals to prevail.  If you believe in happy endings, you are more likely to experience them.  This of course has a huge effect on how the different personality types view death.  Pessimism is a prison that some people impose on themselves.

                    Explanation: Deaths that are unexpected may have more significant impact to grieving families because it feel like 
                    there is no control over the situation. If there was a heads up, there is some control over the situation to solve the 
                    problem. 
                    With a sudden and unexpected death, there is no time for people to accept any upcoming death.

                    Explanation: With no one to rely upon, people will end up doing nothing or relying on themselves. Having no 
                    proper support will cause the situation to grow worse, thus becoming complicated grief. With support, people 
                    can eventually comes to terms with the loss of a loved one and potentially accept death as a natural part 
                    of life.
