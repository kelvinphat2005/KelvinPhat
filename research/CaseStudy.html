        <h2>Evaluating the case study</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>What is most effective in addressing the root causes of this problem?</h3>
            <p>People who have lost their child are connected to others who have gone through the same/similar losses. They provide emotional support, spiritual and therapeutic programs, resources, and any necessary referrals. Their end goal is to give people the strength they need to get through their grief.
            </p>
            <p>They help grieving parents get through their pain by connecting them with other parents who have gone through similar experiences.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>How is or how might technology be used to improve the effectiveness of the ways people are trying to address the root causes of the problem?</h3>
            <p>They have a website that contains information all about them and ways to donate to them so they can keep running. There is a blog so members and supporters can keep informed about the COPE Foundation, read stories of parents, and read healing tips.</p>

        <h2>Implications for your project</h2>
        <h3>What are 1-3 additional implications for what youâ€™ve learned from the case study that can apply to your own project idea - what should you do or not do, what can you improve, what can you adopt and copy? </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We can run a website that people can provide contact information (email, group chats, ect) so they can find people who have went through similar loss. Chatting is a good way to get through grief.</li>
            <li>There can a forum that provides updates on new studies on grief, motivational support, and/or tips</li>
            <li>There can links to other similar organizations and websites</li>
