        <h2>Evaluating the case study</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>What is most effective in addressing the root causes of this problem?</h3>
            <p>The COPE foundation is free of charge</p>
            
            <p>People who have lost their child are connected to others who have gone through the same/similar losses. They provide emotional support, spiritual and therapeutic programs, resources, and any necessary referrals. Their end goal is to give people the strength they need to get through their grief.
            </p>
            <p>They help grieving parents get through their pain by connecting them with other parents who have gone through similar experiences.</p>

            <p>They also have workshops, events, and services which are all supported by donations.</p>

        <p>The JED Foundation helps people deal with those who are apathetic or who have an underlying mental health issue by connecting them with others and educating them.</p>
      <p>Apathy is the lack of emotion, motivation to do anything, or a state of indifference. While it may come from many mental illnesses, it is common for apathy to come from traumatic experience such as the loss of a loved one.</p>
    <p>Similarly to the COPE Foundation, the JED Foundation connects people with others, does workshops, events, and services.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>How is or how might technology be used to improve the effectiveness of the ways people are trying to address the root causes of the problem?</h3>
            <p>Both foundations have a website that contains information all about them and ways to donate to them so they can keep running. There is a blog so members and supporters can keep informed about the COPE and JED Foundation, read stories of parents, and read healing tips.</p>

        <h2>Implications for your project</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>We can run a website that people can provide contact information (email, group chats, ect) so they can find people who have went through similar loss. Chatting is a good way to get through grief.</li>
            <li>There can a forum that provides updates on new studies on grief, motivational support, and/or tips</li>
            <li>There can links to other similar organizations and websites</li>
        </ol>
